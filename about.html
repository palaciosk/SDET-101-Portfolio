                        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hello! I'm a passionate software developer with a love for creating 
                            innovative solutions and beautiful user experiences. My journey in 
                            technology began in high school when I was introduced to programming. Since then 
                            I have been passionate about programming and have been learning new technologies ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that not only strives to 
                            stay updated with the latest technologies and best practices in the 
                            industry, but also keeping up with modern design trends. Beyond coding, I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating with 
                            other passionate developers, and contributing to open-source projects.
                        </p>
